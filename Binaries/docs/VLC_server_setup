0 Introduction
Why we need VLC? Because Flash Player does not let us open/read/play video files except flv, swf
and from the latest beta mp4,etc...   
VLC help us because it can read almost every type of video file with generic compression/encapsulation
and can stream as FLV in a way like FMS does; better, can do that reading local file system. 

Then it's FREE and open-source ;-) 

   
1 Install VLC
Download and install the latest VLC "nightly build" for your OS, from the link at the top of the page (we need the nightly, because the official release 
version does not implement stream as FLV, that is in fact what we use).


2 Run VLC
VLC could run from command line or from desktop; for our purpose the command line version is better because let us specify
as many option as we need.

On Windows OS create a .bat file with the following line, insert the correct path to VLC
(on other OS put the line in a script)

"C:\path\to\VLC\vlc.exe" --no-mmx --no-mmxext --no-audio --extraintf telnet

This way we tell VLC :
    --no-mmx --no-mmxext    not to use mmx instructions (due to a bug, newer pc crash without it) 
    --no-audio              save bandwidth (mandatory, actually VLCmodule does not handle audio)
    --extraintf telnet      allow us to control VLC via telnet commands (sent out from onyx)

To load VLC without the standard graphic interface put --intf telnet instead of --extraintf telnet 
Run the .bat file

3 Modify files.xml
3.1 Manually
Insert an entry with the full path to the file, like 

    <file name="vlc://C:\path\to\your/file/video.avi" thumb="thumbs/video.png" />
  
where the field "name" must contain the full path to the video file (\/ in the path doesn't mind)
and "thumb" is as usual.

NB: not sure at all, but is better to avoid white spaces in the path.

3.2 Automatic
Run OnyxLibrary.jar and click create: will do the job, building the xml files for your video 
folder automatically 

NB: backup xml files is useful to go back!!!!


4 Run Onyx
With VLC loaded run Onyx and look in the console window for the line "VLC loaded"  
Drag your avi/mpg/etc from the browser to a layer and after a bit of delay you should have the
movie playing in Onyx.


5 Bugs
Actually this is a quite buggy feature I'm trying to improve step by step. Some fine tuning 
could be taken into account at VLC command line, some inside the Onyx module.

Most of the issue is due to the fact that the stream coming out from VLC does not contain
metadata (as happen in a normal FLV) so all the info about current video position must be
calculated real time. At the state of the art this mean that the clip could be played only once,
making the stuff useful only for long videos (dvd vobs too).
Also moving the marker back and forth will result in unwanted behaviors :(
